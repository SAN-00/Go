This is a Go practice file that shows three core topics:
1. Maps      -> create, add, update, check if a key exists, and iterate.
2. Pointers  -> pass an *int to a function (IncreaseMarks) and modify it.
3. Methods   -> define a method on a struct (Student.ShowResult) using a
                pointer receiver so it can access the latest field values.
